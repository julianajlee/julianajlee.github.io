## 2020-present
**Research Assistant**, Benoist/Mathis Lab, Department of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, USA

**Project 1: *Mapping genome-wide association of histone post-translational modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K27ac and H3.3) and chromatin-associated proteins (CTCF) in immune cells by using Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) as an Immunological Genome (ImmGen) consortium project***  

&emsp;	- Spearheaded  a  collaborative  work  with  [EpiCypher](https://www.epicypher.com/technologies/cutana/cut-and-run),  an  epigenetics  company  that  launched CUT&RUN, to combat cell population heterogeneity  by optimizing their standard CUT&RUN protocol.  Success  in  CUT&RUN  optimization  and  data  analysis  pipeline  were  demonstrated  in  a submitted manuscript  
&emsp;	- Orchestrated  data collection from  eight  ImmGen-participating  labs  to map chromosome structures across 120 immune cell types  

<br/>
**Project 2: *Management  of  ULI  RNAseq  samples,  and  communal  lab  reagents***

&emsp;	- Collaborated  with  Broad  Institute  to  facilitate  1)  generation  of  ULI  RNAseq  data  produced  by  SMART- Seq2 sequencing kits in batch-mode and 2) distribution of data to sample owners.  
&emsp;	- Worked  on  more  than  2,500  ULI  RNAseq  samples  from  six  labs  from  Harvard  Medical  School, one lab from Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and one lab from University of California San Diego  to  help  produce  high  quality  data,  which  are  used  in  two  publications,  six  manuscripts in progress and one grant proposal.  
&emsp;	- Organized and ordered common laboratory materials, resulting in lab members being able to conduct experiments on time with all reagents.

## 2019-2020
**MSc by Research in Clinical Medicine**, Douglas Group, Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, UK

Thesis: *[A  CRISPR-Cas9  screen  for  hepatocyte  receptors  for  malaria  parasite  invasion](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0529d567-4a65-4abe-9783-5f917abc9aca)*

&emsp;	  - Studied liver stage of malaria by performing high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens to uncover new hepatocyte surface receptors involved in sporozoite invasion, resulting in 1) setting a standard CRISPR-Cas9 screen protocol in studying malaria for general lab use, 2) identification of hepatocyte receptors that play a role in sporozoite invasion and 3) a manuscript in progress.

## 2017-2018
**Undergraduate researcher**, Watts Lab, Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Canada  

**Project 1: *Effect  of  Type  I  and  Type  II  IFNs  on  GITR  ligand  expression  in  moAPCs***  
&emsp; - Investigated causal  transcription  factor  binding  sites  for  GITR  ligand  expression  in  response  to  type  I and  II  IFNs  in  RAW264.7,  a  macrophage-like  mouse  cell  line,  using  Gaussia-Cypridina  dual  luciferase reporter assays.  

<br/>
**Project 2: *Investigation of  rs4761847  SNP  in  *Traf1*  using  CRISPR-Cas9  to  investigate  its  causal  relationship with rheumatoid arthritis.***  
&emsp;	- Designed sgRNA candidates and two repair templates to introduce rs4761847 SNP (A to G) in *Traf1* in THP-1 cell-line using CRISPR-Cas9

<br/>
## Summer 2016
**Queen  Elizabeth  II  Diamond  Jubilee Scholar**, Tailor Lab, National Institute of Immunology, India  

**Project: *Interaction between  IRF8  and  other  transcription  factors  in  CD8+  dendritic  cell  development.***  
&emsp; - Generated lentivirus expressing a plasmid cloned with Irf8-targeting sgRNA and Cas9 from HEK293T. Transduced dendritic cells cultured from Balb/c mice with this lentivirus which resulted in a generation of Irf8^-/-^ cell line for future common lab use.
