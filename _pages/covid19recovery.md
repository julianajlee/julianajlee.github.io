COVID19-RECOVERY PROJECT



The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health in our society by eliciting a sense of isolation and dread. With increased social media consumption, users are exposed to potential misinformation and factors contributing to anxiety or depression. Thus, the COVID-19 Recovery project began to curtail these negative effects with a focus on embodying positive psychology by spreading uplifting, fact-checked news. Realizing the importance of social media in disseminating information, we developed an online presence via cross-platform integration between our website, Facebook and Instagram. 

<br/>
We began our mission of providing positive updates on a daily basis across the world by curating good news articles from various communities. Additionally, we focused on promoting scientific education by creating infographics and writing blog posts explaining the science behind COVID-19 in easily understandable terms. In summer 2020, we received the COVID-19 Student Engagement Award from the University of Toronto, which enabled us to diversify our content by hosting monthly webinars with leaders around the world that helped their communities adapt to the rapidly changing societies.
<br/>
<br/>
As a result of the work from our science, social media, and community webinar teams, we were able to attract over 680 followers on our social media pages, and some of our top posts were able to accumulate over 450 likes and over 6,000 impressions. We reach an average of 1,000 Instagram users each day, most of which are young adults aged from 18-24. We were featured on various news sites, including 11Alive (Atlanta), Curiocity, 680 News, and University of Toronto News. Furthermore, we accumulated over 200 viewers for our webinar series as we discussed how conservation communities, physical trainers, university orientation leaders, and various start-ups were able to continuously support their community through this difficult time.
