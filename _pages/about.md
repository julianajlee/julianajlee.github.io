# About me.

Hi there! My name is Juliana J. Lee, an **immunology** enthusiast :thinking:
What makes a cell, a cell? How are T cells developed? B cells? Macrophages?
As a part of the [Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen)](https://www.immgen.org/) community, I am on a mission to profile *epigenomics* and *transcriptomics* of various immune cell types.

## Academic journey.

### ==2020 - present==
*Research Assistant*, Benoist/Mathis Lab, Department of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, USA

Project 1:
- Mapping genome-wide association of histone post-translational modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K27ac and H3.3) and chromatin-associated proteins (CTCF) in immune cells by using Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) as an Immunological Genome (ImmGen) consortium project 
	- Spearheaded  a  collaborative  work  with  [EpiCypher](https://www.epicypher.com/technologies/cutana/cut-and-run),  an  epigenetics  company  that  launched CUT&RUN, to combat cell population heterogeneity  by optimizing their standard CUT&RUN protocol.  Success  in  CUT&RUN  optimization  and  data  analysis  pipeline  were  demonstrated  in  a submitted manuscript
	- Orchestrated  data collection from  eight  ImmGen-participating  labs  to map chromosome structures across 120 immune cell types

Project 2:
- Management  of  ULI  RNAseq  samples,  and  communal  lab  reagents
	- Collaborated  with  Broad  Institute  to  facilitate  1)  generation  of  ULI  RNAseq  data  produced  by  SMART- Seq2 sequencing kits in batch-mode and 2) distribution of data to sample owners.
	- Worked  on  more  than  2,500  ULI  RNAseq  samples  from  six  labs  from  Harvard  Medical  School, one lab from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and one lab from University of California San Diego  to  help  produce  high  quality  data,  which  are  used  in  two  publications,  six  manuscripts in progress and one grant proposal.
	- Organized and ordered common laboratory materials, resulting in lab members being able to conduct experiments on time with all reagents.

### 2019-2020
*MSc by Research in Clinical Medicine*, Douglas Group, Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, UK

Thesis: 
- [A  CRISPR-Cas9  screen  for  hepatocyte  receptors  for  malaria  parasite  invasion](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0529d567-4a65-4abe-9783-5f917abc9aca)
	- Studied liver stage of malaria by performing high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens to uncover new hepatocyte surface receptors involved in sporozoite invasion, resulting in 1) setting a standard CRISPR-Cas9 screen protocol in studying malaria for general lab use, 2) identification of hepatocyte receptors that play a role in sporozoite invasion and 3) a manuscript in progress.

### 2017-2018
*Undergraduate researcher*, Watts Lab, Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Canada

Project 1: 
- Effect  of  Type  I  and  Type  II  IFNs  on  GITR  ligand  expression  in  moAPCs
	- Investigated causal  transcription  factor  binding  sites  for  GITR  ligand  expression  in  response  to  type  I and  II  IFNs  in  RAW264.7,  a  macrophage-like  mouse  cell  line,  using  Gaussia-Cypridina  dual  luciferase reporter assays.

Project 2:
- Investigation of  rs4761847  SNP  in  *Traf1*  using  CRISPR-Cas9  to  investigate  its  causal  relationship with rheumatoid arthritis.
	- Designed sgRNA candidates and two repair templates to introduce rs4761847 SNP (A to G) in *Traf1* in THP-1 cell-line using CRISPR-Cas9

### Summer 2016
*Queen  Elizabeth  II  Diamond  Jubilee Scholar*, Tailor Lab, National Institute of Immunology, India

Project: Interaction between  IRF8  and  other  transcription  factors  in  CD8+  dendritic  cell  development.
- Generated lentivirus expressing a plasmid cloned with Irf8-targeting sgRNA and Cas9 from HEK293T. Transduced dendritic cells cultured from Balb/c mice with this lentivirus which resulted in a generation of Irf8^-/-^ cell line for future common lab use.
