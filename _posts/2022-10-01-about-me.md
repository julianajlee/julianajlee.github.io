Hi there! <br/> My name is Juliana, an **immunology** enthusiast :) <br/>
What makes a cell, a cell? <br/>
How are T cells developed? <br/>
B cells? Macrophages? <br/>
As a part of the [Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen)](https://www.immgen.org/) community, I am on a mission to profile *epigenomics* and *transcriptomics* of various immune cell types.
