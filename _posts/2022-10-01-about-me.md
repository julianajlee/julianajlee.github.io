# About Me.
Hi there!  
My name is Juliana, an **immunology** enthusiast :)  As a part of the [Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen)](https://www.immgen.org/) community, I am on a mission to profile _epigenomics_ and _transcriptomics_ of various immune cell types.  
  
There are lots of immunology questions in this world that have not been answered yet.  How many subtypes of T cells are there? B cells? Macrophages? How do they maintain host homeostasis and fight infection? What makes a lymphocyte, a lymphocyte? This can get philosophical really quickly...  
  
If you wish to learn more about me, scroll the navigation bar on the left and click whatever you want. I have a wide range of collection from CV to coding practices to photography.   
  
  
......are you still reading this? Go on, navigate through the navigation bar!
